# Oldliner

Twelve years ago, I wrote an outliner in the browser, but stalled out when it came time to write the server storage layer. Now I have [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/). Ho ho ho. (Oldliner only saves your work if you're running it in a browser that supports the `dat://` protocol and DatArchive API.)

### How to install:

- Visit [dat://oldliner-misuba.hashbase.io/](dat://oldliner-misuba.hashbase.io/)

- Fork

- Click the thing in the upper right corner
